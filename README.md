# Learning Mojo

Me trying to learn Mojo.

This repo contains my first codes in Mojo ðŸ”¥, trying to understand the ins and outs of it.

My main goal is to understand the Modular platform and develop applications leveraging artificial intelligence as a distinctive approach to solve user problems.

## Plan to learn

Study examples provided by the Mojo team and modify them to probe my understanding.

Some of the thing I want to create:

1. A sentiment analysis application
2. Running a classification model on the server

## Running the examples

Run the following command to run the examples:

```bash
mojo run example.mojo
```

Replace `example` with the name of the file you want to run, like tihs:

```bash
mojo run basic/hello.mojo
```
